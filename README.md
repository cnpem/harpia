# HARPIA

## Description

**Harpia** (High Algorithmic Performance for Image Analysis) is a CUDA-accelerated library for large-scale volumetric image processing and segmentation, developed at the [Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS)](https://lnls.cnpem.br/).  
It provides a scalable backend for scientific imaging applications, tightly integrated with [Annotat3D](https://github.com/cnpem/annotat3d), enabling interactive segmentation of datasets that exceed single-GPU memory capacity.

Harpia emphasizes **strict memory control**, **chunked execution**, and a **modular C++/CUDA architecture**, making it well-suited for **HPC and remote multi-user environments**. It delivers performance and scalability beyond widely used frameworks such as cuCIM and scikit-image.

Main features include:

- **Chunked-based Execution**: Native GPU-aware partitioning of large volumes, ensuring scalability and continuity across chunk boundaries.
- **Memory-Safe GPU Resource Management**: Predictable allocation/deallocation to support concurrent, multi-user HPC workflows.
- **High-Performance Filtering Suite**: CUDA implementations of anisotropic diffusion, median, Gaussian, non-local means, unsharp mask, Sobel, and Prewitt filters.
- **Morphological Operations**: Fully GPU-accelerated 2D/3D erosions, dilations, openings, closings, geodesic reconstruction, smoothing, fill holes, and snakes.
- **Thresholding Methods**: CUDA implementations of Otsu, Sauvola, Niblack, adaptive mean, and adaptive Gaussian.
- **Superpixel and Feature Extraction**: GPU kernels for superpixel segmentation, feature pooling, and descriptors such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Hessian-based measures.
- **Quantification Tools**: Area, volume, perimeter, fraction, connected components, and OpenMP-accelerated Euclidean Distance Transform.
- **Annotation Support**: Accelerated active contours, watershed, and intuitive 2D/3D editing modules for human-in-the-loop segmentation.

## Project Status

Harpia is under **active development**. Current releases provide stable GPU-accelerated modules and Python bindings. Future work includes:

- Multi-GPU scheduling and heterogeneous computing support
- Dynamic tuning of chunk sizes
- Integration with advanced AI/ML models for segmentation refinement
